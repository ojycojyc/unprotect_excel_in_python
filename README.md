** I, the author, am using data obtained from the Data For Good - Montreal chapter's  "Maison des Femmes" project.

Because the data is sensitive, I cannot make it available to the public via GitHub.

I will endeavor to make a sample Excel file with the assumed protection available in this repository in the future.
